# Chicago Taxi Trips Deep Learning with Dashboard

In this project, we have built a deep learning model on top of the infamous [Chicago City Taxi Trips](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Taxi-Trips/wrvz-psew) 
dataset using Spark, and also built a dashboard for seeing the model in action using Streamlit and FastAPI. The dataset itself is open for public use and holds information since 2013, amounting to about 200 Million rows with each record being around 1024 bytes in size.
